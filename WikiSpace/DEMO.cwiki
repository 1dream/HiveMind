h3. HiveMind TODO:

* space page tree - find fancy jquery widget
* change space creation to include drop-down for resource type (in HiveMind component, in runtime/WikiSpace, in dbfile, in jcr content) and build root page based on that
* try links to headers in other pages
* wiki search - use solr, or elastic search?

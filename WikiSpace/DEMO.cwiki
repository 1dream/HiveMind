h3. HiveMind TODO

* implement move of page to under different parent
* implement rename of page (and corresponding directory)
* add support for page attachments with corresponding file structure

* space page tree - find fancy jquery widget
* wiki search - use solr, or elastic search?
* for non-public spaces check to see if user is associated as admin, contributor, or viewer
